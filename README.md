# How to Host web server
The Linux distro we’ll be using for this setup is Ubuntu. However, this can be implemented in any Linux distro. At the end of this tutorial, you can host your PHP and MySQL-based website on your own Linux machine.

After following this tutorial, you must set up your web server. The real challenge, however, is protecting your server from thousands of active threats. If you’re not an expert in managing Linux servers, it is strongly advised to use web hosting services that take care of security.

The tutorial is divided into two parts. In the first part, we discuss the essential components and their installation. In the next section, we shall write sample PHP code for an essential website and host it under the apache2 webserver.

Prerequisites To host Web Server
To set up a web server on your own Linux computer, we’ll require the following three components to be installed –

Apache2: apache2 is open-source HTTP server. It is still the most popular web-server used worldwide today.
php and php sqlite component: PHP is a server-side scripting language. PHP and its component will help you to interact with a backend mySQL database for your website.
mySQL: mySQL is a database solution in which you shall be storing your data in the table.
If you have installed the above components, you can skip this part and move to the next part here.

## JSON — short for JavaScript Object Notation — is a popular format for storing and exchanging data. As the name suggests, JSON is derived from JavaScript but later embraced by other programming languages.

### JSON file ends with a .json extension but not compulsory to store the JSON data in a file. You can define a JSON object or an array in JavaScript or HTML files.

#### In a nutshell, JSON is lightweight, human-readable, and needs less formatting, which makes it a good alternative to XML.
